    <h2>Why</h2>

    <p>
      I am a very mouse-driven developer. I will opt to use mouse over keyboard
      even in situations where it is frankly stupid to do so. I am generally
      unapologetic in this. I daily drive VSCode which has pretty terrible
      click-to-select-code support. When I wrote Clojure professionally I used
      Emacs, which I was more or less glad to drop, but I miss being able to
      double click on paretheses to select their contents. AFAICT this is
      neither possible in VSCode vanilla nor by extention.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like a lot of things I've ended up implementing in Hazel, click-to-select
      was not on my critical path, either acdemically or with respect to skill
      development, but simply because it beckoned. And, as a more-or-less
      structured editor, Hazel (surely) has a very clear internal model of
      semantically meaningful segments of code, so implementing a nice,
      syntax-guided selection mode should be straightforward.
    </p>

    <h2>What</h2>

    <p>
      And it was, to a first approximation. (Link to PR) But soon that first
      approximation became palapably approximative, so I've revisted the
      functionality as part of my upcoming Hazel Summer Refresh (link to PR).
    </p>

    <p>
      The reasons it didn't work perfectly before are partly about the
      implementation, and partly more conceptual. When it comes down to it, the
      issue is: What does it mean to be a meaningful sub-part of code? In
      particular, meaningful to the user with respect to ergonomic code
      transformation, which is closely related but distinct from the meaning of
      the code to the backend; the formal semantics.
    </p>

    <h2>How</h2>

    <p>
      After spending the last few years developping a language and editor in a
      small but now rapidly growing team setting, I now have some amount of
      clarity on what a 'term' is to different people. In particular, the notion
      of 'a term' becomes clearer and more obvious the more you learn about
      programming lanugage theory in the abstract sense, and less clear and less
      obvious the more you learn about parsing and language in general. In
      (natural) linguistics, there no general agreement on what a 'word' is.
    </p>

    <p>
      In progamming language 'linguistics', you need to contend with the
      often-blurry division between lexing and parsing, the distortions of
      languages into lopsided grammars required to satisfy the formal
      requirements of some parsing framework, and in structured editing, the
      fact that what seems cleanly a term from an implementation perspective may
      not line up with user expectations. Fundamentally, modern progamming
      language syntax, and the traditional algebraic notation it derives from,
      are both intricate and incidental, with many special cases cooperating in
      non-obvious ways.
    </p>

    <h2>Terms in Hazel</h2>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://tylr.fun">Tylr engine</a> underlying Hazel defines a
      paradigm called tile-based editing. (link to paper) In this framework,
      every syntactic form is a tile, which is not necessarily a complete term,
      although it does (in combination with its precdence), effectively define
      one.
